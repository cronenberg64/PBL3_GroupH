# Smart Re-Identification System for Stray Cats Post-TNR Program

[Project Documentation Website](https://xknt21.github.io/)

A mobile application built with React Native and integrated with an image-based cat re-identification system to prevent redundant medical treatments of stray cats. This system is designed to support volunteers, animal hospitals, and TNR organizations, especially in the Kansai region of Japan. This project is made as a part of a Project-Based-Learning Course which spans over 15 weeks.

---

## Project Objective

To streamline the Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR) process and reduce unnecessary hospital visits for stray cats by enabling users to:

- Identify previously captured and treated cats using AI-based image matching.
- View and manage cat profiles with medical histories.
- Coordinate efficiently between caretakers, hospitals, and organizations.
- Ensure data integrity, usability, and privacy compliance.

---

## Features

### Cat Re-Identification
- Upload or capture a photo of a stray cat to check for prior registration.
- AI provides a confidence score and match result (high, moderate, or low).
- Feedback system for users to report false matches.

### Account Management
- Role-based access for Volunteers, Animal Hospitals, and Administrators.
- Profile creation, editing, verification, and deletion supported.
- Password recovery and secure authentication mechanisms.

### Medical Record System
- View and update cat profiles: age, gender, vaccination status, and treatment history.
- Hospitals can log surgeries and medical interventions.
- Tagging system (e.g., neutered, under treatment, released).

### Image Submission Workflow
- Supports photo capture via device camera or gallery upload.
- Validates format, size, and resolution (≥ 1280x720, ≤ 5MB).
- Mobile and offline-capable submission process.

### Administration & Analytics
- System dashboards for match statistics and cat counts.
- Access control, audit logs, and activity tracking.
- Re-ID match reviews and visualization of trends.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/cat-reid-app.git
   cd cat-reid-app
   ```

2. Backend Setup (Flask)
   - Install Python dependencies:
     ```sh
     pip install flask ultralytics opencv-python
     ```
   - Register known cats:
     ```sh
     python ai_model/register_known_cats.py
     ```
   - Start the server:
     ```sh
     python serve.py
     ```
   - The server will run on `http://<your-ip>:5000`.

3. Mobile App Setup (Expo)
   - Install Node.js (v18+) and Expo CLI:
     ```sh
     npm install -g expo-cli
     ```
   - Install dependencies:
     ```sh
     cd PBL3Expo
     npm install
     npx expo install expo-camera expo-image-picker
     ```
   - Start the app:
     ```sh
     npm start
     ```
   - Run on your phone:
     1. Install Expo Go from the App Store/Google Play.
     2. Connect your phone and computer to the same WiFi.
     3. Scan the QR code from the terminal/browser.

## Usage

1. Open the mobile app (on phone or emulator)
2. Take a photo or choose from gallery
3. Tap 'Identify Cat'
4. View results (match, no match, or error)
5. Configure server in the Explore tab if needed
